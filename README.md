# ruby_game_dev
more ruby practice - this time, through game development

this is a whack-a-mole ruby game.  it's prescriptive, based on "learn game programming with ruby" by pragprog book.  has lots of room to customize though.  

i really wanted to whack the real mole - trump!, so will change the .png image that won't get me on the list of his long lawsuits, as soon as i find one.
